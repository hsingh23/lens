## Background
Lens is built on top of [Readability Redux](https://github.com/MHordecki/readability-redux) and borrows design ideas on [iReader](http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/ireader-decluttered-reading-chrome-firefox/). It runs **automatically** on all websites, displaying a page only if carefully chosen conditions are met.

Lens is going to be a community assembly project soon, once we get 100 users.
